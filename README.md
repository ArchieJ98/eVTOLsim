# eVTOL_Simulation

eVTOL_sim functions as a simulation tool designed to evaluate the behaviour of electric vertical takeoff and landing otherwise known as eVTOL vehicles. The simulator allows users to analyze eVTOLs through evaluations of flight dynamics together with control systems and electrical performance.

## Features

- **Language**: The tool operates through a complete implementation of C++ that guarantees high efficiency along with cross-platform compatibility
- **Modular setup**: Enables straightforward incorporation of flight dynamics and additional company types
- **Multi-Vehicle Simulation**: Simulates 20 vehicles across 5 different company types
- **Realistic Flight Modeling**: Tracks battery consumption, distance flown, and passenger miles
- **Fault Simulation**: Simulates faults to mimic real time scenarios with performance degradation
- **Charging Management**: Queue-based charging system with configurable charger count
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Detailed logging of flight times, distances, charging sessions, and faults
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily customizable design for unit testing

## How It Works

### 1. Initialization Phase
- Creates 5 vehicle type definitions with different performance characteristics
- Randomly instantiates 20 vehicles from these types
- Initializes charging infrastructure (3 chargers by default)

### 2. Simulation Loop
- **Flight Phase**: Vehicles fly until battery depletion, consuming energy based on speed and distance
- **Fault Detection**: Random faults occur based on probability, degrading cruise speed by a fraction
- **Charging Phase**: Depleted vehicles request charging, queued if necessary
- **Statistics Logging**: All events are logged for analysis

### 3. Output Generation
- Console summary with per vehicle type statistics
- Detailed re-writable fault log with timestamps and degradation tracking to a text file

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests:

- **Simulation_Test.cpp**: Tests core simulation functionality
- **Statistics_Test.cpp**: Tests vehicle data aggregation and logging
- **ChargerManager_Test.cpp**: Tests charging queue management and updation
- **VehicleInstance_Test.cpp**: Tests individual vehicle behavior

## Customization

### Modifying Vehicle Types
Edit `src/Simulation.cpp` in the `vehicle_Init()` method:
```cpp
vehicle_Types.emplace_back(Vehicle("New Company", 150, 400, 0.5, 2.0, 6, 0.15));
```

### Adjusting Simulation Parameters
In `src/Simulation.cpp` constructor:
```cpp
Simulation::Simulation():chargers(stats, 5),sim_time(4.0), current_time(0.0), time_Increment(0.1){}
```

### Changing Charger Count
Modify the ChargerManager constructor call in `Simulation.cpp`:
```cpp
chargers(stats, 10)  // 10 chargers instead of 3
```

## Key Metrics Tracked

- **Flight Performance**: Time, distance, passenger miles per flight
- **Charging Efficiency**: Time spent charging, queue wait times
- **Reliability**: Fault frequency and performance degradation
- **Fleet Utilization**: Overall system throughput and efficiency

## Assumptions

1. Each vehicle starts the simulation with a fully-charged battery.
2. Each vehicle instantaneously reaches Cruise Speed.
3. Each vehicle is airborne for the full use of the battery, and is immediately in line for the charger 
   after running out of battery power.
4. Vehicles follow a fly -> charge -> fly pattern until the simulation time ends.
5. Each fault triggered will impact the cruising speed by a small fraction to show the impact of faults in the system

## TODO: Future Optimizations and Enhancements

1. Introduce Multithreading: Parallelizing vehicle flight and charging logic using threads, synchronizing access to shared resources like charger queue and stats using mutexes.
2. Dynamic configuration: Reading the vehicle configurations from a config file or input via command line.
3. Advanced Fault Handling: Introduce fault levels to show the level of impact of a fault on the system and customized faults and degradation for each parameter.
4. Time Scheduler: Using schedulers to model events like flight, fault occurrence, queue promotion, and charging.
5. Advanced logging: Data can be put into JSON packets and posted to a server where all faults and analysis are logged.
6. Add battery degradation: Battery degrades over time as all batteries do which will impact charge and ultimately flight performance.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Compilation Errors:**
- Ensure C++17 support is enabled (`-std=c++17`)
- Check that all source files are included in compilation

**Runtime Issues:**
- Verify `fault_log.txt` has write permissions
- Check console output for error messages

**Test Failures:**
- Run individual test files to isolate issues
- Check that random number generation is working properly

For additional support, please check the test files for usage examples or create an issue with specific error details.
